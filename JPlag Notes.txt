*** OVERALL PLAN ***

	-> Key differences will likely be between the JplagCsharp6Listener and the JplagJava7Listener
	-> CSharp6TokenConstant is missing various JavaTokenConstants. Some have no equivalents but some have simply not been implemented. May be causing problems.


*** TODO ***

	--> move on to tokens not yet implemented (don't forget unit tests!)
		--> C# attributes == java annotations?
	--> multiple token unit tests


*** MAYBE ***

	--> should we...
		--> add method calls?
		--> add ++/-- to ASSIGN? ==> minimal gain
		--> add goto? structs? ==> not for ISU
	
	--> reference assembly better match to java import?
	--> nest all using statements into one token?


*** EVENTUALLY ***

	--> VOID and ARRAY_INIT may not be matching as well as expected, but it's probably ok for now
		--> need to correct method_declaration grammar
		--> need to correct class_definition grammar
		--> need to correct array_initializer grammar


*** CURRENT STEP ***

	--> move on to tokens not yet implemented
