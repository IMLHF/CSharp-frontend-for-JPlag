*** OVERALL PLAN ***

	-> Key differences will likely be between the JplagCsharp6Listener and the JplagJava7Listener
	-> CSharp6TokenConstant is missing various JavaTokenConstants. Some have no equivalents but some have simply not been implemented. May be causing problems.
	-> CSharp parser is split between the CSharpParser and the CSharpPreprocessorParser. Preprocessor may not be necessary but may be causing problems
	          -> There is a CSharpAntlrParser.cs snippet that may be required to use the preprocessor parser correctly.

	-> Parser.parseFile() updated to use non-deprecated functions. May be causing problems
	-> Grammar requires newer version of Antlr. May be causing problems.


*** TODO ***

	--> fix antlr grammar noise...

	--> minimal token specific unit tests
		// init array
			--> ARRARY_INIT matches "int[] arr2 = { 0, 1, 2 };" but not "arr1 = new int[] { 9, 8, 7 };" What should it match?

		// do-while, while, for, foreach
		// switch, case
		// if-else
		// try-catch-finally-using
		// enum

		// constructor, members ==> class
		// break, continue, ==> if/loops
		// return, throw, void ==> methods

	--> larger multiple token tests
		--> VAR_CONST recognizes 'int i' in for loop but not foreach?
	
	--> try end not where it should be
	--> if/else does not end where it should be?
	--> problems with CLASS_MEMBER_DECLARATIONS. do we even need them?

	--> move on to tokens not yet implemented


*** MAYBE ***

	--> AnonymousClass.java?

	--> should we add method calls?
	--> Should we add increment/decrement?

	--> should we expand CASE to begin/end?
	--> should we expand NAMESPACE to begin/end?


	--> C# attributes are the equivalent of java annotations?
	--> reference assembly better match to java import?

	--> expand CLASS_DEFINITION grammar?
	--> expand METHOD_DECLARATION grammar?


*** CURRENT STEP ***

	--> unit testing current tokens, verifying their grammar and matching java17 listener
